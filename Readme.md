- Thanks to [mikeholscher](https://github.com/mikeholscher) for the bases of the pg1316 footprints. I modified them heavly to improve soldering and adapted them to ergogen but the original was provided on his [Github](https://github.com/mikeholscher/zmk-config-mikefive/tree/main/files/footprint-and-cad)
